## About Instahood

Finally you can see what's going on in your neighborhood, in real time!  Instahood uses HTML5 geolocation to 
find the most recent Instagram photos taken around you, plots them on the map and shows their thumbnails
in a gallery.  You can interact with the gallery photos or the map icons to zoom into the photo and check
out the photo's caption.

Nothing going on around you?  No problem!  Click anywhere on the map or use the search in the navigation
bar to see what's going on anywhere in the world!

Instahood was originally built as a [Meteor](http://meteor.com/) application and uses the 
[Google Maps Javascript API v3](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) and the 
[Instagram API](http://http://instagram.com/developer/).  

Instahood made the front page of Hacker News on March 16, 2013, made it all the way up to the second 
highest spot and in one week had over 10,000 unique visitors!

## About Me

Instahood was built by [Mike Adams](http://mikeincode.com) about half way through the 13 week Javascript
bootcamp at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com).
